## About me:
<p>

    Tech enthusiast with an interdisciplinary background in aerospace, manufacturing, and IT infrastructure. 
    Linux and FOSS software are my main areas of interest, including RHEL clones, Arch, Ansible, and Docker. 
    I'm handy with Python, know just enough to be dangerous with C/C++, and would like to eventually be fluent in Rust,
    which I believe is where the Linux kernel is headed long-term.
    I'm a huge MikroTik fan for my networking pursuits, due to their incredibly generous and permissable licensing model.

    In my free time, I like to cook, paint, read, and mess around with amateur radio (FCC General class operator).

## Why this site?

<p>

    Using a github repo to host a website came to me as an odd idea one afternoon, which I wanted to experiment with.  5 mins and some DNS magic and it was off to the races....
    Save money, live better (R).
